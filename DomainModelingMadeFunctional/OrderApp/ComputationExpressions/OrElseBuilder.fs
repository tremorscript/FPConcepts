    Chains of "or else" tests
    
    Sometimes the flow of control depends on a series of "or else" tests.
    Try one thing, and if that succeeds, you're done.
    Otherwise try another thing, and if that fails, try a third thing, and so on.
    
    Say that we have three dictionaries and we want to find the value corresponding to a key.
    Each lookup might succeed or fail, so we need to chain the lookups in a series.
